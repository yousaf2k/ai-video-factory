## Example Prompts

**Parthenon Construction:**
```
"A documentary shot of the Parthenon under construction on the Athenian Acropolis, 445 BCE. Workers in simple linen chitons haul Pentelic marble blocks on sledges. The Doric temple rises majestically - its perfect proportions revealing the genius of Iktinus and Callicrates. Fluted columns stand complete, the entablature with triglyphs and metopes being assembled. Phidias directs sculptors carving the pedimental sculptures. Scaffolding made of timber supports the structure. The Erechtheion construction is visible nearby. Behind the Acropolis walls, the city of Athens spreads to the sea. Intense golden-hour sunlight catches the warm honey tones of the fresh marble. Shot on 24mm wide-angle lens, deep focus, architectural photography, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Classical Parthenon construction, not yet weathered by time."
```

**Athenian Democracy in Action:**
```
"A wide shot of the Athenian assembly (ekklesia) on the Pnyx Hill, 440 BCE. Approximately 6,000 male citizens gather in the natural amphitheater. Citizens stand or sit on the hillside, wearing simple chitons and himations. A speaker stands on the bema, gesturing dramatically as he addresses the crowd - perhaps Pericles proposing the Parthenon building program. Men show approval or disapproval with shouts and hand gestures. The Acropolis with its temples rises in the background. The atmosphere is electric with political debate and democratic participation. Dust kicked up by citizens' feet. Harsh midday Mediterranean sun creates strong contrasts. Shot on 35mm lens, deep focus, National Geographic documentary style, 8K resolution. Authentic Athenian democracy during Periclean Athens."
```

**Red-Figure Pottery:**
```
"An intimate close-up shot of the Achilles Painter creating a red-figure kylix in Athens, 490 BCE. The painter carefully applies the black slip, leaving the figures in reserve - the red-figure technique allowing fluid lines and three-quarter views. The scene shows Achilles binding Patroclus' wounds. Nearby, finished red-figure vessels display the artistic mastery - a pelike by the Berlin Painter with satyrs and maenads, a lekythos with domestic scenes. The workshop receives natural light through an opening. The painter and his assistant wear simple linen tunics. Delicate brushes and tools lie ready. Shot on 100mm macro lens, shallow depth of field, documentary photography, hyper-realistic textures of clay and pigment. 8K resolution. Authentic Classical red-figure pottery, no later Hellenistic styles."
```

**Socrates Teaching:**
```
"A portrait shot of Socrates teaching in the Athenian agora, 400 BCE. The philosopher, recognizable by his snub nose, bulging eyes, and unkempt appearance, stands surrounded by young men. He wears a simple rough himation, going barefoot as was his custom. His face bears the characteristic Socratic irony as he questions his students through the elenchus method. Around him: Plato (young, bearded), Alcibiades (aristocratic, handsome), other disciples. The Stoa of Zeus Eleutherius provides shade. In the background, citizens go about their daily business - some pausing to listen. Soft morning light filters through the colonnade. Shot on 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field, professional DSLR, hyper-realistic details of faces and fabric. Authentic Classical Athens, not Roman copy."
```

**Trireme Fleet:**
```
"A dramatic wide shot of the Athenian trireme fleet in Piraeus harbor, 430 BCE. Three-banked warships with bronze beaks (embola) ready for action. Rowers (170 per ship) sit at their benches, practicing maneuvers. The triremes show their distinctive design - eyes painted on prows, decorative stern ornaments. Marines (epibatai) stand ready with armor and shields. The ship's commander (trierarch) gives orders from the rear. The long walls connecting Athens to Piraeus stretch into the distance. The Aegean Sea reflects the morning sun. The atmosphere is one of military readiness and naval power. Shot on 70-200mm telephoto lens from a nearby dock, compression showing the fleet. National Geographic documentary style, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Classical Athenian navy before Peloponnesian War."
```

**Battle of Marathon:**
```
"An action-packed shot of the Battle of Marathon, 490 BCE. The Athenian hoplite phalanx charges across the plain, 10 ranks deep, running to close distance quickly before Persian archers can fire. The citizens wear bronze Corinthian helmets with horsehair crests, linen cuirasses, greaves. Their round aspis shields bear the owl of Athena. The Persian line waits with archers and cavalry - the flowing robes and pointed hats contrasting with Greek bronze. Dust kicks up from thousands of feet. The tension of the moment before impact is palpable. The plain of Marathon stretches to the sea, where the Persian fleet is beached. Dramatic low-angle shot captures the charging phalanx. Shot on 50mm lens, documentary photojournalism, hyper-realistic battle scene. 8K resolution. Authentic historical battle, not stylized Hollywood version."
```

**Theater of Dionysus:**
```
"A cultural shot of the Theater of Dionysus during the City Dionysia festival, 425 BCE. The theater carved into the southern slope of the Acropolis is packed with citizens. On the orchestral floor, the chorus of Sophocles' 'Oedipus Rex' performs - 15 citizens in tragic masks moving in unison. The actors wear masks with exaggerated expressions. The theatrical machine (theologeion) allows the appearance of deities. Citizens in the audience react emotionally - some weeping, others tense. The Acropolis looms above, the Parthenon illuminated by torchlight as dusk falls. The atmosphere is one of cathartic tragedy and communal experience. Shot on 50mm lens, deep focus from actors to audience, documentary style, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Classical Greek tragedy performance, not modern adaptation."
```

**Alexander at Gaugamela:**
```
"A dramatic shot of Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela, 331 BCE. The young king (only 25) rides Bucephalas at the head of the Companion cavalry (hetairoi). He wears the distinctive lion-skin helmet of Heracles (his symbolic ancestor), a white chlamys, and carries the xyston lance. His face shows characteristic intensity and determination. Behind him, the Macedonian phalanx forms a wall of sarissas (6m pikes). Persian forces stretch to the horizon under Darius III. The dust of thousands of horses and men fills the air. The sun creates dramatic backlighting. This is the moment that will end the Persian Empire and change the world. Shot on 135mm telephoto lens, shallow depth of field focusing on Alexander, cinematic documentary, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic historical reconstruction, not Oliver Stone's movie."
```

**Spartan Agoge:**
```
"A documentary shot of Spartan youth undergoing the agoge training, 400 BCE. Naked boys exercise in the palaestra - wrestling, running, throwing the discus and javelin. Older youths (ebontes) spar with minimal padding. A paidonomos (governess) supervises with a whip. The training ground is simple, Spartan in its austerity - no luxury, only physical excellence. The boys show determination and endurance beyond their years. In the background, Spartan citizens go about their business - all dressed in simple red chitoniskoi. The Taygetos mountains rise in the distance. Harsh midday sun beats down. Shot on 50mm lens, documentary photography, hyper-realistic physical exertion and Spartan austerity. 8K resolution. Authentic Classical Spartan education, not stylized '300' movie version."
```

**Plato's Academy:**
```
"An intellectual scene at Plato's Academy in the grove of Academus, 365 BCE. Plato (middle-aged, bearded) teaches a group of young men including the young Aristotle. They sit on stone benches in the olive grove, surrounded by nature. A slave takes dictation as Plato expounds on his Theory of Forms. Other students engage in dialogue or read from papyrus scrolls. The sanctuary of the hero Hecademus with its olive trees provides shade. The atmosphere is one of intellectual pursuit and philosophical inquiry. Gentle morning light filters through the trees. Shot on 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field, documentary style, hyper-realistic details of faces and setting. 8K resolution. Authentic Classical Greek philosophy, no modern anachronisms."
