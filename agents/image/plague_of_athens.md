## Historical Context & Accuracy

### The Plague (430-426 BCE)

**Timeline and Spread:**
- **First outbreak**: Year 2 of the war (430 BCE), shortly after Spartan invasion of Attica
- **Origin**: Said to have begun in "parts of Ethiopia above Egypt" and spread through Egypt, Libya, and much of the Persian Empire
- **Entry**: Arrived at Piraeus (Athenian harbor), then spread to Athens
- **Subsequent outbreaks**: 429 BCE, and 427-425 BCE (though less severe)
- **Duration**: Approximately 5 years with intermittent outbreaks

**Historical Context:**
- **Peloponnesian War**: Athens vs. Sparta (431-404 BCE)
- **Pericles' strategy**: Athenians withdrew behind the Long Walls, population crowded into the city
- **Overcrowding**: Refugees from the countryside packed into Athens
- **Perfect conditions**: Overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, stress, malnutrition

**Human Impact:**
- **Death toll**: Estimated 25% of Athenian population died (~75,000-100,000 people)
- **Victims**: Citizens, metics, slaves - no class was spared
- **Pericles** (c. 495-429 BCE): The great leader died in 429 BCE
- **Citizenship rolls**: Dramatically reduced, affecting military and political capacity

**Symptoms (as described by Thucydides):**

**Early symptoms:**
- **Sudden onset**: Seemingly healthy people suddenly became ill
- **Heat in the head**: Inflammation and burning sensation in the head
- **Redness and inflammation**: In the eyes, throat, and tongue
- **Foul breath**: The breath became unnatural and offensive

**Progression:**
- **Sneezing**: Followed by sneezing and hoarseness
- **Pain**: Severe pain in the chest, violent coughing
- **Stomach upset**: Vomiting, retching, bilious symptoms
- **Skin**: Reddish and livid coloration, small blisters and ulcers
- **Extreme thirst**: Most died within 7-9 days from dehydration

**Late symptoms (in survivors):**
- **Constipation**: After initial diarrhea, victims became constipated
- **Attack on extremities**: Inflammation spread to the genitals, fingers, and toes
- **Gangrene**: Some survived but lost fingers, toes, or genitals
- **Memory loss**: Many who recovered had no memory of their illness
- **Blindness**: Some lost their sight (though not all)

### Physical and Social Conditions

**Athens During the Plague:**

- **Sanitation**: Overwhelmed infrastructure, inadequate waste disposal
- **Water**: Stagnant cisterns, contaminated water sources
- **Shelter**: People lived in temporary shelters, porches, public buildings
- **Dead in the streets**: Bodies accumulated before they could be buried
- **Bodies abandoned**: Traditional burial rites abandoned due to scale of death

**Piraeus Harbor:**
- **Origin point**: Plague first appeared here
- **Trade ships**: Likely brought by traders from the East
- **Storage facilities**: Contaminated supplies
- **Abandoned**: Many sailors fled, leaving ships unmanned

**Temple Areas:**
- **Acropolis**: Traditional refuge, but plague spread even here

## Example Prompts

**Athens Streets - Abandoned Dead:**
```
"A somber street scene in Athens, summer 430 BCE. The narrow street between mud-brick houses shows signs of the plague's devastation. Bodies lie on the ground covered with simple cloths, waiting for collection. A few survivors move cautiously through the street - emaciated, with haunted eyes, wearing simple chitons and himations. Smoke from funeral pyres rises in the background. The Acropolis with its temples is visible on the hill. Overcrowding is evident - refugees camp in doorways, temporary shelters in the street. The air is thick with smoke and dust. Harsh midday sun creates deep shadows. Shot on 50mm lens, f/4, documentary photojournalism, hyper-realistic but respectful depiction of suffering. 8K resolution. Authentic historical event, not sensationalized."
```

**Victim in Agony:**
```
"A compassionate close-up shot of an Athenian man lying on a pallet in his home, 430 BCE. The man shows plague symptoms described by Thucydides - red, inflamed skin, fever-sweated body, desperate thirst. His chiton is soaked with sweat. A water basin sits beside him, empty. His wife, her face etched with fear and exhaustion, wets his lips with a cloth. In the background, a small shrine to Apollo with offerings - the family praying for divine help. The room is simple, with a few possessions. Natural light from a small window illuminates the scene. Shot on 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field focusing on the victim, documentary photography, hyper-realistic details showing symptoms. 8K resolution. Authentic historical reconstruction, not sensationalized."
```

**Abandoned Burial Rites:**
```
"A poignant scene at a burial ground outside Athens, 430 BCE. Traditional funeral rites have been abandoned due to the scale of death. Bodies are being placed in a mass grave without the customary offerings or libations. Mourners stand at a distance, unable to perform traditional funerary customs. Some bodies are being carried on makeshift stretchers. Traditional grave markers, funerary urns, and offerings are absent. The ground is dry and dusty. The Acropolis and Parthenon are visible in the distance. Smoke from multiple pyres fills the air. Sunset light creates a somber, mournful atmosphere. Shot on 70mm telephoto lens, compressing the depth, documentary style, 8K ultra-detailed. Historical authenticity based on Thucydides' account of abandoned burial customs."
```

**Temple Refugees:**
```
"A somber scene on the Athenian Acropolis, summer 430 BCE. Refugees from the countryside, forced to flee behind the Long Walls, have taken shelter in the sacred precincts. Women, children, and elderly people camp on the steps and in the shadow of the Parthenon, then under construction (447-432 BCE). Their simple belongings are scattered around - blankets, food containers, water jars. Some show signs of illness. The juxtaposition of human suffering and the beautiful temple under construction creates stark contrast. Traditional religious practices are being violated by necessity. The priests of Athena look on with concern. Harsh Mediterranean sun beats down. Shot on 35mm wide-angle lens, deep focus, documentary photography, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic historical moment - overcrowding behind Long Walls led to plague conditions."
```

**Pericles' Deathbed:**
```
"A historical shot of Pericles on his deathbed, 429 BCE. The great Athenian leader, aged approximately 66, lies dying of the plague in his home. His family - wife (possibly Aspasia) and sons (Xanthippus and Paralus, who would die of the plague) - gather around. Pericles wears a simple white himation, his face gaunt from illness. Behind him, a representation of the owl of Athena - symbol of the city he led. Outside the window, the Acropolis is visible. The atmosphere is heavy with the knowledge that Athens has lost its greatest leader at a critical moment in the Peloponnesian War. Soft, diffused light suggests the approaching end. Shot on 85mm portrait lens, f/2.8, historical reconstruction, hyper-realistic details of face and fabric. 8K resolution. Authentic historical moment that changed the course of the war."
```

**Funeral Pyres:**
```
"A night scene showing multiple funeral pyres burning outside Athens, 430 BCE. Bodies are being cremated rather than buried due to the overwhelming number of deaths. The flames rise high against the night sky. The intense heat illuminates the scene. Pyres are built of wood and fuel - precious resources given the scale of death. Survivors watch at a respectful distance. The smoke from multiple pyres creates a hazy atmosphere. The Acropolis with the partly-built Parthenon is silhouetted against the flames. The scene is both tragic and necessary - traditional burial rites impossible at this scale. Shot on 50mm lens, f/2.8, late evening lighting, documentary style, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic historical reconstruction of Thucydides' description of abandoned burial rites during the plague."
```

**Lawlessness and Despair:**
```
"A street scene showing the breakdown of social order, 430 BCE. In a dimly lit Athenian alley, a crime is being committed openly - people taking what they want, knowing that traditional laws are not being enforced. The image captures Thucydides' observation that people stopped fearing the law or its enforcement. A man grabs food from a stall, the stall owner too weak to protest. Others walk by with indifference or despair. Some show signs of plague, others are simply taking advantage of chaos. The atmosphere is one of moral collapse - people believing they will die soon, so they might as well enjoy themselves. Twilight lighting creates a gloomy, desperate mood. Shot on 35mm lens, f/2.8, documentary photojournalism, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic historical event showing the social breakdown described by Thucydides."
```

**Caregivers at Risk:**
```
"A compassionate scene showing caregivers tending to plague victims, 430 BCE. Women and some men tend to the sick in improvised settings - homes, shelters, even outdoors. They offer water to those suffering from thirst, cool fevers with damp cloths, provide what comfort they can. The caregivers themselves show signs of exhaustion and fear - some appear ill themselves. Thucydides noted that those who tended the sick died most frequently. The setting is a simple courtyard or house. The victims lie on pallets or mats. Traditional remedies are shown - water, wine, herbs. Natural side-lighting reveals the compassion and risk. Shot on 50mm lens, f/4, documentary photography, hyper-realistic but dignified depiction. 8K resolution. Historical accuracy showing the human cost of caregiving."
```

**Epic Wide Shot - Athens in Crisis:**
```
"IMAX scale wide shot of plague-stricken Athens at dusk, summer 430 BCE. The camera captures the entire city from an elevated vantage point, showing the devastating scale of the epidemic. The Acropolis rises in the background with the partly-built Parthenon silhouetted against a fiery orange sunset. Multiple funeral pyres burn simultaneously across the city, their smoke columns merging into a dark shroud over Athens. Streets that should be bustling with life are eerily quiet, with bodies lying covered along the roadways. The Long Walls encircle the overcrowded city, trapping refugees within. The scale is overwhelming - a civilization in crisis. Shot on Sony Venice 2 with Arri Signature Prime Lenses, 16mm ultra-wide cinematic masterpiece, 8K resolution. The epic grandeur of the scene emphasizes the magnitude of this historical tragedy. Authentic historical reconstruction based on Thucydides' account, cinematic documentary style."

## Video & Motion Prompt Guidelines (For Wan 2.2 I2V)

The `motion_prompt` must NOT just be camera directions. It must describe a living, moving scene to guide the video generation model.

When writing the `motion_prompt`, follow these strict rules:

1. **Summarize the Scene:** Briefly state what is in the shot (e.g., "A street scene in plague-stricken Athens...", "A view of the burial grounds...").
2. **Subject Motion (Verbs):** Describe exactly how the people are moving. Use dynamic verbs (e.g., "Survivors walk slowly through the streets," "A woman tends to a sick man," "People carry bodies on stretchers").
3. **Environmental Motion:** Describe how the elements react (e.g., "Smoke rises from funeral pyres," "Dust swirls in the wind," "Flames flicker," "Fabric drapes naturally").
4. **Camera Movement:** End with the camera instruction (e.g., "The camera slowly pans left," "Static camera capturing the somber atmosphere").
5. **NO PHOTOGRAPHY TERMS:** You MUST strip out all static photography terms from the motion prompt. Do NOT include terms like "8K", "50mm", "f/8", "DSLR", "hyper-detailed", "sharp focus", or "ISO" in the motion prompt. Use cinematic pacing terms instead ("cinematic pacing," "fluid motion," "natural movement").

**Example structure:**
```
"[Scene context with people] + [Specific movements of subjects] + [Environmental effects like smoke/wind] + [Camera movement]. Cinematic pacing, realistic physics, fluid natural motion."
