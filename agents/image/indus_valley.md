Looking down a perfectly straight secondary street where a covered brick drain runs alongside the roadway. The drain features a stone lintel cover with inspection openings. Clear water flows through the precisely laid brick channel. A resident opens an inspection hatch to clean debris while another person pours water from a clay pot into a drain outlet from their home. The brick walls are freshly laid with sharp edges and clean mortar. A potter works at a wheel in a courtyard visible through an open doorway. Professional DSLR capture, macro detail photography, sharp focus on construction quality. Natural side-lighting reveals texture and precision. No ruins, no broken drains, no erosion."

He intently shapes a carnelian bead using a stone drill bow, his fingers calloused from years of work. His workspace is organized with finished beads of faience, carnelian, and lapis lazuli arranged in pottery bowls. Tools made of copper and stone lie within reach. A copper mirror hangs on the nearby wall, reflecting sunlight. Sunlight streams through the doorway, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. In the background, finished necklaces hang on a wooden display stand. The brick walls are freshly plastered and smooth.

Boatsmen wearing simple white cotton waist-cloths use long poles to guide vessels through gentle currents. On the riverbank, a dock area features pristine brick ramps for loading goods. Male traders in dhotis with robes over their left shoulders negotiate prices while porters in loincloths carry cargo to waiting ox carts. Women vendors in knee-length skirts and colorful shawls sell textiles—some wearing red-dyed cotton, others in indigo-blue. Gold bangles gleam on their arms as they gesture. The city's citadel rises on the western horizon with its massive fortification walls clearly visible. The river reflects the golden light of late afternoon. Reed beds line the shore.
