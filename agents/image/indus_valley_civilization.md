The citadel rises on the western side, dominated by the Great Bath and public buildings. The lower city contains hundreds of houses arranged around courtyards. The Indus River winds through the background, with cultivated fields and irrigation channels visible. Smoke rises from cooking fires. People move through the streets - merchants, craftspeople, families going about their day. The scale is impressive - a city of 40,000 people. Golden hour lighting creates long shadows and warm tones. Ultra-wide aerial cinematography, 8K resolution, hyper-realistic details. Authentic Indus Valley Civilization urban planning - no marble, no anachronisms, accurate mud-brick architecture."
```

**The Great Bath:**
```
"Cinematic wide shot of the Great Bath in Mohenjo-Daro, 2500 BCE. The massive rectangular pool (39×23 feet) dominates a large courtyard surrounded by colonnades and rooms. Water fills the pool to near the top, reflecting the sky. Two staircases descend into the water. The brickwork is precise and uniform, with waterproof bitumen sealing visible at waterline. People in simple wrapped cotton garments move through the colonnades - some preparing for ritual purification, others simply gathering. The citadel walls rise in the background. Late afternoon sunlight creates dramatic shadows. Shot on 35mm cine lens, documentary cinematography style, 8K ultra-detailed. Historically accurate reconstruction based on archaeological excavations - no speculation beyond the evidence."
```

**Indus Valley Market:**
```
"Documentary shot of a bustling market in Harappa, 2200 BCE. The marketplace is a large open area where merchants display goods on wooden tables and woven mats. Stalls sell red pottery with black painted designs, copper tools and vessels, carnelian and lapis lazuli beads, cotton textiles, and food items - grain, vegetables, fruits. Merchants in wrapped cotton garments and turbans negotiate prices. Stone weights are used for measuring goods. Scribes keep records on clay tablets. In the background, the citadel and granaries are visible. Dust motes float in shafts of sunlight. Natural documentary lighting captures the texture of fabrics, pottery, and metalwork. Shot on 50mm lens, National Geographic style, 8K hyper-realistic. Authentic Bronze Age Indus Valley market scene."
```

**Seal Carver at Work:**
```
"Intimate close-up documentary shot of an Indus Valley craftsman carving a steatite seal, 2300 BCE. The artisan sits cross-legged on a woven mat, holding a small piece of soft gray stone (steatite). With a bronze tool, he carefully incises the image of a bull - one of the most common seal motifs. Around him are finished seals showing unicorns, elephants, and script symbols. A small oil lamp provides illumination. His hands show years of work - strong, with copper bangles on wrists. The setting is a simple workshop with finished seals displayed on low tables. Shallow depth of field focuses on his hands and the seal. Shot on 85mm macro lens, f/2.8, documentary cinematography, hyper-realistic textures of stone and bronze. 8K resolution showing the intricate carving work."
```

**Street Scene with Drainage:**
```
"Documentary street-level shot in Mohenjo-Daro, 2400 BCE. A straight street runs precisely north-south, lined with mud-brick buildings of uniform height. The street is bustling - people in wrapped cotton garments walk by, some carrying water pots, others with goods for trade. A child plays with a wheeled terracotta cart on the ground. Most remarkably, the street has a covered drainage channel running along it - brick arches covering a large sewer. Drain holes from buildings discharge into it. This is 4,500 years ago, yet more sanitary than many modern cities. In the background, more streets recede into the distance, all following the same precise grid. Harsh midday sun creates deep shadows. Shot on 24mm wide-angle lens, documentary photojournalism style, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Indus Valley urban sanitation."
```

**Trade with Mesopotamia:**
```
"Cinematic wide shot of Indus Valley merchants loading boats at the port of Lothal, 2300 BCE. The dockyard is a sophisticated engineering feat - brick-lined dock with channels for boats. Merchants in simple wrapped garments load cargo onto flat-bottomed boats: wooden chests containing carnelian beads, bundles of cotton textiles, bags of lapis lazuli from distant mountains. Scribes record the cargo on clay tablets. The boats will sail down the Sabarmati River to the Arabian Sea, then along the coast to Mesopotamian ports. In the distance, other boats are unloading copper from Oman (Magan). The dockyard is busy but organized - a testament to sophisticated trade networks spanning thousands of miles. Golden morning light reflects off the water. Shot on 35mm cine lens, deep focus, documentary style, 8K resolution. Authentic Indus Valley maritime trade reconstruction."
```

**Family Life:**
```
"Documentary medium shot of family life in a courtyard house in Mohenjo-Daro, 2400 BCE. The central courtyard is the heart of the home. A woman in a sari-like wrapped cotton garment with gold bangles grinds grain on a stone quern. Nearby, a child plays with a terracotta animal toy. An older man sits weaving cotton fabric on a simple loom. The courtyard has a small well with a bucket for water. Rooms open onto the courtyard - their windows face inward, not the street. The walls are mud-plastered brick. A small shrine in one corner has a few offering bowls. A copper water pot sits near the well. The setting is simple but comfortable - this is a middle-class home, not a palace. Soft diffused light enters from above. Shot on 50mm lens, documentary cinematography, hyper-realistic domestic details. 8K resolution showing everyday life in the Indus Valley Civilization."
```

**Bronze Casting:**
```
"Technical documentary shot of bronze casting in Harappa, 2300 BCE. In a specialized workshop, craftsmen work with copper and tin to create bronze objects. A furnace glows with charcoal fire, its heat visible in shimmering air. A craftsman uses tongs to handle a crucible of molten bronze. Another prepares a stone mold for casting. Finished bronze objects sit nearby - vessels, tools, and the famous dancing girl figurine. The workers wear simple loincloths, protected from the heat. The workshop is organized with raw materials, finished goods, and tools arranged systematically. The skill required is evident - bronze casting is complex metallurgy. Natural side-lighting emphasizes the golden glow of molten metal. Shot on 50mm lens, documentary style, hyper-realistic textures of bronze, stone, and fire. 8K resolution showing Bronze Age technology."

## Video & Motion Prompt Guidelines (For Wan 2.2 I2V)

The `motion_prompt` must NOT just be camera directions. It must describe a living, moving scene to guide the video generation model.

When writing the `motion_prompt`, follow these strict rules:

1. **Summarize the Scene:** Briefly state what is in the shot (e.g., "A wide shot of the Great Bath...", "Aerial view of Mohenjo-Daro streets...").
2. **Subject Motion (Verbs):** Describe exactly how the people/animals are moving. Use dynamic verbs (e.g., "Priests slowly descend the steps," "Traders gesture with their hands," "A woman draws water," "Children chase each other").
3. **Environmental Motion:** Describe how the elements react (e.g., "Water ripples gently," "Cotton garments flutter in the warm breeze," "Dust swirls softly in the sunlight," "Smoke rises from cooking fires," "Flames flicker in the furnace").
4. **Camera Movement:** End with the camera instruction (e.g., "The camera slowly pans right," "Static camera capturing the fluid motion," "Drone ascends slowly").
5. **NO PHOTOGRAPHY TERMS:** You MUST strip out all static photography terms from the motion prompt. Do NOT include terms like "8K", "50mm", "f/8", "DSLR", "hyper-detailed", "sharp focus", or "ISO" in the motion prompt, as this causes the video model to freeze or flicker. Use cinematic pacing terms instead ("cinematic pacing," "fluid motion," "natural movement").

**Example structure:**
```
"[Scene context with people/animals] + [Specific dynamic movements of subjects] + [Environmental effects like water/wind/fire] + [Camera movement]. Cinematic pacing, realistic physics, fluid natural motion."
```

**Good motion prompt example:**
"A wide view of the Great Bath courtyard. People in white cotton garments slowly descend the brick steps into the water, their fabric flowing naturally with each movement. Priests walk purposefully along the colonnade, their arms gently swaying. Water ripples across the surface of the pool, reflecting the sunlight. Soft breeze causes loose fabric to flutter. Static camera, cinematic pacing, fluid natural motion."

**Bad motion prompt example (DO NOT DO THIS):**
"8K hyper-detailed shot of Great Bath. 50mm lens f/2.8. Sharp focus on water. 4K cinematic quality. Static shot."
(This causes video generation to freeze or flicker)
