"A scholarly shot inside the Great Library of Alexandria, 250 BCE. Rows of scroll shelves (bibliothecae) stretch into the distance, containing 500,000 papyrus scrolls from across the known world. Scholars in Greek chitons and himations read at tables - some debating philosophy, others copying texts, some studying scientific diagrams. Jewish scholars translate Hebrew scriptures into Greek (the Septuagint). Librarians organize new acquisitions. The light filters in through high windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The atmosphere is one of intellectual intensity - the world's greatest repository of knowledge. Shot on 50mm lens, f/2.8, documentary style, hyper-realistic textures of papyrus and wood. 8K resolution. Authentic Hellenistic scholarship, not modern library."
```

**Pharos Lighthouse:**
```
"A majestic shot of the Pharos Lighthouse at Alexandria, 280 BCE. The massive stone tower rises approximately 110 meters (360 feet) from the island of Pharos. Three tiers: square base, octagonal middle section, cylindrical top with the fire. Bronze mirrors reflect the fire's light at night - a beacon visible for 50 kilometers. Ships enter the harbor guided by its light. The lighthouse is built from white limestone and granite blocks. Construction scaffolding still clings to portions as final work continues. The harbor bustles with merchant ships from across the Mediterranean - Egypt, Greece, Carthage, the Near East. Sunset golden hour creates dramatic backlighting with seagulls circling the tower. Shot on 70-200mm telephoto lens from a ship entering the harbor, compression showing the lighthouse against the sky. National Geographic documentary style, 8K ultra-detailed. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World."
```

**Winged Victory of Samothrace:**
```
"An artistic shot of the Nike of Samothrace being created, 190 BCE. The sculptor (possibly from Rhodes) works on the marble masterpiece in a studio. The Winged Victory stands on the prow of a warship, her wings outstretched, wind-blown drapery clinging to her body as if she has just descended. The marble is fresh from Paros, white and pristine. The sculptor uses chisels and abrasives to create the incredible detail - feathers on the wings, fabric folds showing the wind's force, the power and grace of the goddess. Tools and marble chips surround the statue. Natural light from an opening illuminates the work. Shot on 100mm macro lens, shallow depth of field, hyper-realistic textures of marble and artistic process. 8K resolution. Authentic Hellenistic masterpiece, not Louvre museum copy."
```

**Euclid Teaching:**
```
"An educational scene in the Museion of Alexandria, 300 BCE. Euclid stands before a group of students from across the Hellenistic world - Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, Babylonians. He uses a wax tablet and compass to demonstrate geometric propositions. The students sit on benches, some taking notes on wax tablets, others asking questions. Geometrical diagrams are drawn on boards behind Euclid. Scrolls of earlier mathematical works (Pythagoras, Thales) lie ready for reference. The atmosphere is one of focused intellectual inquiry - the foundations of geometry being established. Natural morning light filters into the teaching room. Shot on 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field focusing on Euclid, documentary style, hyper-realistic. 8K resolution. Authentic Hellenistic mathematics, not modern classroom."
```

**Archimedes' Inventions:**
```
"A workshop scene in Syracuse, 250 BCE. Archimedes demonstrates his latest invention to Hieron II's court. The Claw of Archimedes (iron claw) lifts a model ship with a simple crane mechanism - the weapon that would lift and capsize Roman ships. Other inventions lie around the workshop: bronze screw for irrigation (Archimedes' screw), compound pulleys, models of planetarium spheres. Archimedes, older with a gray beard, explains in Greek while pointing to the mechanisms. Syracusan officials watch with amazement. Bronze tools, wooden models, papyrus diagrams cover the worktables. Natural side-lighting reveals metallic textures and mechanical details. Shot on 50mm lens, f/4, documentary photography, hyper-realistic textures of bronze and wood. 8K resolution. Authentic Hellenistic engineering, not modern recreation."
```

**Cleopatra's Court:**
```
"A dramatic scene at the Ptolemaic court in Alexandria, 47 BCE. Cleopatra VII, young and strikingly beautiful, holds court in the palace. She wears Egyptian royal dress - elaborate headdress with uraeus (cobra), sheer linen dress with gold embroidery, heavy jewelry including double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. Behind her stands Mark Antony, Roman general in Roman military dress with laurel wreath. Around them: Ptolemaic nobles in Greek dress, Egyptian priests in white linen, Roman soldiers in armor. The fusion of Greek, Egyptian, and Roman power is visible. The palace room shows Hellenistic luxury - marble columns, gold fixtures, frescoes depicting Isis and Aphrodite. Dramatic lighting creates tension and opulence. Shot on 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field, cinematic documentary, hyper-realistic textures of fabric and gold. 8K resolution. Authentic historical moment before Actium."
```

**Multi-Ethnic Market:**
```
"A bustling street scene in Antioch, 150 BCE. The market showcases the Hellenistic world's cosmopolitan nature. Greek merchants in chitons sell wine and olive oil. Syrian traders in Eastern dress sell spices, silks, and carpets. Babylonian astronomers debate in a corner. Jewish merchants sell goods from Judea. Bactrian Greeks in trousers and long sleeves (Eastern dress) trade with Parthian merchants. The street follows a grid plan (Hippodamian) with colonnaded sidewalks. In the background, the Temple of Apollo with its Corinthian columns rises. People speak many languages - Greek, Aramaic, Hebrew, Persian. The sensory richness of international trade is evident - smells of spices and incense, sounds of many languages, sights of exotic goods. Shot on 35mm wide-angle lens, deep focus, National Geographic documentary style, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Hellenistic multiculturalism."
```

**Battle of Actium:**
```
"A dramatic naval shot of the Battle of Actium, 31 BCE. The combined fleet of Octavian (Marcus Agrippa) and Antony/Cleopatra clashes in the Ambracian Gulf. Roman quinqueremes with the "harax" (corvus) boarding bridges face off against Cleopatra's Egyptian-style warships. Antony's flagship is visible, its distinctive purple sail unfurled. Cleopatra's Egyptian squadron tries to break through to open sea. The battle is chaotic - ramming, boarding missiles, burning ships. The coastline of Epirus is visible in the background with troops watching. Smoke from burning ships fills the air. The fate of the Hellenistic world hangs in the balance. Low-angle shot from a Roman ship captures the intensity. Shot on 70-200mm telephoto lens, documentary photojournalism, hyper-realistic naval battle. 8K resolution. Authentic historical reconstruction, not stylized movie version."
```

## Video & Motion Prompt Guidelines (For Wan 2.2 I2V)

The `motion_prompt` must NOT just be camera directions. It must describe a living, moving scene to guide the video generation model.

When writing the `motion_prompt`, follow these strict rules:

1. **Summarize the Scene:** Briefly state what is in the shot (e.g., "The great library of Alexandria...", "A multicultural harbor scene...").
2. **Subject Motion (Verbs):** Describe exactly how the people/animals are moving. Use dynamic verbs (e.g., "Scholars study scrolls," "Merchants from many lands trade goods," "Ships sail into harbor").
3. **Environmental Motion:** Describe how the elements react (e.g., "Sea breeze moves fabrics," "Water laps against docks," "Desert wind carries sand").
4. **Camera Movement:** End with the camera instruction (e.g., "The camera slowly tracks through the library," "Drone ascends over the city").
5. **NO PHOTOGRAPHY TERMS:** You MUST strip out all static photography terms from the motion prompt. Do NOT include terms like "8K", "50mm", "f/8", "DSLR", "hyper-detailed", "sharp focus", or "ISO" in the motion prompt. Use cinematic pacing terms instead ("cinematic pacing," "fluid motion," "natural movement").

{USER_INPUT}

---

**Remember**: You are portraying the Hellenistic Period - the age when Greek culture went global. Show Alexandria with its Library and Pharos, the multicultural cities of Antioch and Pergamon, the scientific achievements of Euclid and Archimedes, the dramatic art of Winged Victory and Laocoön, the fusion of Greek and Eastern traditions, and the coming of Rome that would end this era. Capture the cosmopolitan, international, scientific character of this remarkable period when Greek ideas spread across the known world and merged with local cultures to create something new and vibrant.
