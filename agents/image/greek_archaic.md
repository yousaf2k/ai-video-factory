## Example Prompts

**Early Temple Construction:**
```
"A documentary shot of the Temple of Apollo at Corinth under construction, 550 BCE. Workers in simple linen tunics haul marble blocks on sledges. The Doric temple rises from its stylobate - heavy fluted columns with simple capitals, no base. The entablature shows triglyphs and metopes. Scaffold poles made of timber support the partially built structure. Stone masons work with bronze tools, carving column drums. Dust and marble chips cover the ground. The acropolis of Corinth rises in the background, with the bustling city below. Intense Mediterranean sunlight creates strong shadows. Shot on 35mm lens, deep focus, architectural photography, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Archaic Greek temple construction. No classical perfection, no Parthenon-style refinements."
```

**Black-Figure Pottery Workshop:**
```
"An intimate close-up shot of an Athenian pottery workshop, 520 BCE. A painter works on a black-figure amphora, carefully incising details through the black slip. The scene shows Heracles fighting the Nemean lion. Nearby, finished black-figure vessels dry in rows - kylikes with drinking scenes, lekythoi with funeral motifs, amphorae with Dionysus. The potter's wheel spins as another vessel takes shape. The workshop is open-air with a woven shelter. Both men wear simple linen chitons. Natural side-lighting reveals texture of clay and painted details. Shot on 100mm macro lens, shallow depth of field, documentary photography, hyper-realistic textures of clay and pigment. 8K resolution. Authentic Athenian black-figure pottery, no red-figure vessels."
```

**Hoplite Phalanx:**
```
"A dynamic shot of a Greek hoplite phalanx advancing, 490 BCE, just before Marathon. The citizens of Athens in bronze Corinthian helmets with horsehair crests carry round aspis shields painted with Athenian owl blazons. They wear bronze muscle cuirasses and greaves. Their long iron spears (dory) form a forest of points. The phalanx is 8 ranks deep, moving in disciplined formation. Dust kicks up from their sandaled feet. The Persian line is visible in the distance. Low-angle shot captures the imposing wall of bronze and spears. Shot on 50mm lens, documentary photojournalism, hyper-realistic details of bronze armor and weapons. Authentic Archaic hoplite warfare, no classical Spartan perfection."
```

**Olympic Stadium:**
```
"A wide shot of the Olympic stadium during the footrace, 480 BCE. The stadion is a packed earth track approximately 192 meters long. Spectators line the grassy banks - men from various Greek city-states, identifiable by their clothing. The runners, nude in the Greek athletic tradition, sprint down the track toward the finish line. A hellanodikes (judge) in a black chiton stands at the finish. The altar of Zeus is visible in the background with offerings. Intense midday sun creates dramatic shadows. The atmosphere is electric with competition. Shot on 70-200mm telephoto lens from the side, compression showing the runners and crowd. National Geographic documentary style, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Olympic Games, no modern stadium."
```

**Kouros Statue:**
```
"A portrait shot of a newly completed kouros statue, 530 BCE. The life-size marble statue of a young man stands in front of a wealthy family's tomb on the road to Kerameikos cemetery. The kouros shows characteristic Archaic style - frontal pose, left foot forward, arms at sides, archaic smile, braided hair with bead-like curls, anatomical details rendered but stylized. The marble is fresh from the sculptor's workshop, white and pristine. The sculptor's tools lie nearby - chisels, rasps, abrasives. Family members in fine linen himation admire the memorial. Soft morning light illuminates the statue. Shot on 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field, professional DSLR, hyper-realistic texture of marble. Authentic Archaic kouros, not classical realism."
```

**Athenian Agora:**
```
"A wide shot of the Athenian Agora in 500 BCE, the political and commercial heart of the city. Citizens gather in groups - some discuss politics in the shadow of the Royal Stoa, others examine pottery at merchant stalls. The Tholos (round building) where the prytaneis dine stands nearby. Metics (resident foreigners) sell goods from around the Mediterranean - Egyptian papyrus, Phoenician purple dye, Thracian metalwork. Citizens in simple chitons and himations walk on the dusty paths. The Acropolis rises in the background with the Old Temple of Athena visible. The scene bustles with Archaic energy. Shot on 24mm wide-angle lens, deep focus, documentary photography, 8K ultra-detailed. Authentic Archaic Agora, no classical buildings."
```

**Colonization Expedition:**
```
"A dramatic shot of Greek colonists preparing to sail, 650 BCE. On the beach at Corinth, families board a penteconter (50-oared galley). Men carry supplies - amphorae of olive oil and wine, tools, weapons, household goods. Women and children stand on the shore, some weeping, some excited. The ship is painted with eyes on the prow. Warriors hoplites stand guard with their gear. The leader (oikistes) gives final instructions. Behind them, the city of Corinth fades into distance - they're heading to found a new colony in Sicily or southern Italy. The Aegean Sea reflects the golden light of dawn. Shot on 35mm lens, cinematic documentary, hyper-realistic, emotional departure moment. 8K resolution. Authentic Archaic Greek colonization movement."
```

**Delphic Oracle:**
```
"A mystical shot of the sanctuary at Delphi, 550 BCE. The Pythia (priestess of Apollo) sits on a tripod over the sacred chasm in the adyton of the Temple of Apollo. The temple's Doric columns frame the scene. Vapors rise from the chasm. Priests in white robes interpret her utterances for a petitioner - a Athenian strategos seeking divine guidance before a military campaign. The temple interior is dim with flickering oil lamps. Offerings of tripods and statuettes fill the temple. Outside, the treasury buildings of various city-states line the sacred way. Dramatic lighting with shafts of light entering through the doorway. Shot on 50mm lens, f/2.8, documentary style, hyper-realistic atmosphere. Authentic Archaic Delphi, no classical temple."
```

**Tyrant's Court:**
```
"A scene at the court of Peisistratus in Athens, 540 BCE. The tyrant sits on a ceremonial chair (throne-like but not ornate - still Archaic period). He wears a fine himation and carries a scepter. Around him, his supporters and advisors - aristocrats who've aligned with him, metics who've benefited from his patronage, soldiers loyal to him. In the background, the Acropolis where he's added buildings and monuments. The atmosphere is one of power and stability but also tension - those who oppose him are absent or silent. Natural light from an opening illuminates the scene. Shot on 85mm lens, documentary style, hyper-realistic political drama. 8K resolution. Authentic Archaic tyranny period, not full democracy yet."
